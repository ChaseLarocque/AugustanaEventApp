This is a Android application that focuses on retrieving and displaying events that take place on the Augustana campus. Users are able to log in via Google Sign-in and are distinguishable to grant special permissions. It has many features that are intended to future proof the app. Before reaching the event calendar, a main menu consists of external Augustana links that redirect users to different activities.This main menu can later be altered to include other features.

For the event calendar, it fetches events that are made on a master calendar via the Google Calendar API. The Calendar UI consists of an add event button that allows events to be pushed to the master calendar without having to directly go to the Google Calendar and add an event there. Dates will display an indicator that tells the user how many events will take place on that day. The filter categories and edit event button are to be soon implemented.

*Project was made for AUCSC 330 - Software Engineering II at the University of Alberta, Augustana Campus.*
